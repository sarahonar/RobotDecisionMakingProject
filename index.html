<p>Autonomous systems face immense challenges when operating in uncertain, and unstructured dynamic environments. To safely navigate environments with unpredictable obstacles, these systems require robust decision-making capabilities. Consider an autonomous robot moving through crowded spaces filled with people, cars, and other obstacles whose motions cannot be precisely predicted. Without adequate safety precautions, the robot risks collisions and failures. While achieving absolute safety may not be possible, mathematical tools like control barrier functions provide formal guarantees on maintaining critical safety constraints. By leveraging these methods, we can enable autonomous systems like robots to make provably safe decisions, avoiding hazards in their complex, uncertain worlds. The remainder of this article will explore the theory and application of control barrier functions to robotic decision-making under uncertainty.</p>  
<p>Summary: In control theory, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) ensure the safety of dynamic systems under certain conditions. </p>
