 <h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>In control theory, control barrier functions (CBFs) provide formal guarantees that a dynamic system will remain within a defined safe operating space. By constraining a barrier function to be nonnegative, CBFs ensure a system avoids entering undesirable or unsafe states during operation. For example, CBFs could keep a robot from getting too close to the edge of a table, or keep a vehicle from getting near the shoulder of a road. They provide a way to mathematically box a system into making only safe decisions. </p>
